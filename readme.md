# NodeJS CRUD

I aim to learn and fix in my mind nodejs fundamentals. It will be coded a rest API without any lib like fastify or express.

With this API, I should be able to:
- Create a new Task
- Retrieve / get all tasks
- Update a task by it's ID
- Delete a task by it's ID
- Check a task as complete by it's ID
- Import massive tasks from a CSV file
